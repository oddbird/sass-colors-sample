[CSS Colors Level 4][color-4]
adds support for non-srgb color-spaces,
and additional color formats.
In order to add that support to the [Sass language][sass],
we need to redefine how colors are stored,
and add the necessary tools for
managing multiple color spaces.

This is sample proof-of-concept code,
implementing & testing
some of the required processes and functions,
as we develop the (work in progress)
[Sass colors proposal][proposal].
